Facebook Data
This repository contains the source code of my final solution written in C# using Visual studio. 

My final solution is a windows form application that executes SQL of imported data that displays sorted Facebook data into a gridview. The graphical user interface contains 5 buttons to display each of the following tables: Users, Friendships, Messages, Universities and Workplace which are all related to a standard User's profile on facebook. There's also a grid view to display the contents in. 

I've written the program to be connected to MySQL as it's imperative to pull the data in for display Therefore it should also be noted that classes were written to automatically log in to my MySQL account which is required to connect to the database.

The program is all commented.
